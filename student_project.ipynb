    "**Context**: EHR data is becoming a key source of real-world evidence (RWE) for the pharmaceutical industry and regulators to [make decisions on clinical trials](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/speeches-fda-officials/breaking-down-barriers-between-clinical-trials-and-clinical-care-incorporating-real-world-evidence). You are a data scientist for an exciting unicorn healthcare startup that has created a groundbreaking diabetes drug that is ready for clinical trial testing. It is a very unique and sensitive drug that requires administering the drug over at least 5-7 days of time in the hospital with frequent monitoring/testing and patient medication adherence training with a mobile application. You have been provided a patient dataset from a client partner and are tasked with building a predictive model that can identify which type of patients the company should focus their efforts testing this drug on. Target patients are people that are likely to be in the hospital for this duration of time and will not incur significant additional costs for administering this drug to the patient and monitoring.  \n",

This may indicate a Missing Completely At Random scenario (e.g. the scale being broken or unavailable at the hospital). Medical specialty also has a fair number of missing values, but it's possible that this is for systemic reasons (e.g. if the doctor is not a specialist, perhaps the field is simply left blank). NDC codes are missing for about 16% of entries here. This is most likely Missing Not At Random because not all patients receive medication as a result of their visit.\n",

It's perfectly reasonable to have a very high unique count for encounter_id and patient_number, as our dataset is large (and these numbers would grow noticeably if we were to add data). In terms of dimensionality reduction, we can ignore these as they are effectively indexing info, not things for our model to learn from.\n",

The final notable category is ndc_code, which, when looking at the schema, could easily have its dimensionality reduced by using the non-proprietary code or some similar method."
